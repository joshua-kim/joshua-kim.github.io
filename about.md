Hi, my name is Joshua Kim!

It's nice to meet you. Thanks for stopping by my blog. If you're here I guess you're curious to learn more about me.

I'm a software engineer based in New York City. I currently work on the [Avalanche](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/commits?author=joshua-kim) cryptocurrency protocol. Most of my interests are in distributed systems and web3.

I started this blog as a place to write down my thoughts and musings. When I was younger I used to journal religiously - often times multiple times in a single day.

I began this habit as a way of coping with mental health issues that I had at the time, but found over time that it was a very enjoyable activity where I could be alone with my thoughts and look back on what I was thinking at different points in my life.

I also really enjoy well written technical articles, and hope to offer my perspective on some random technical subjects that I feel particularly passionate about. I don't claim to be an expert on any specific subject, but I consider myself someone who enjoys learning and I find that one of the best ways to learn is to try to explain it to ~~someone~~ an imaginary audience through a blog post.

At any rate, thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy reading my blog and learning about who I am and how I think.

Good meeting you!
