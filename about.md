Hi, my name is Josh.

It's nice to meet you - thanks for stopping by my blog.

I'm a software engineer based in New York. I currently work on the [Avalanche](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/commits?author=joshua-kim) cryptocurrency protocol. Most of my interests are in distributed systems and web3.

Good meeting you!

\- J
