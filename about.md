Hi, my name is Joshua Kim!

It's nice to meet you. Thanks for stopping by my blog. If you're here I guess you're curious to learn more about me.

I'm a software engineer based in New York City. I currently work on the [Avalanche](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/commits?author=joshua-kim) cryptocurrency protocol. Most of my interests are in distributed systems and web3.

At any rate, thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy reading my blog and learning about who I am and how I think.

Good meeting you!
