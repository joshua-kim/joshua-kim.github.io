"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" - Laozi

---

The value of reading and writing was something that I remember evolving over time as I grew.

When I was young, I didn't go outside much. I was raised in suburban and rural areas and rarely left my neighborhood except to attend religious services and soccer practice.

In my childhood, I taught myself how to read. It turns out that having no way to entertain yourself other than staring at books makes you see patterns in the weird symbols on the pages with enough time.

In elementary school, my barely-literate English language skills were enough for me to make friends online. I was a shy kid, but it was easy making friends over the internet, a world free of discrimination as long as I was shielded behind the pseudo-anonymity of my trusty username. I joined online communities through forums to make friends with like-minded people who shared my interests. With today's social media, most of those communities are now unfortunately obsolete and I get overwhelemed with a wave of nostalgia when I think about those bygone days of the internet.

As a college student, I used writing to vent and record my thoughts in a journal. I fell into a very dark time in my life where I was surrounded by negative thoughts. I was poor - I remember spending only 30$ in a month on food, and barely scraping money to pay for my rent.

Fast-forward to today and I find that with every year I have more responsibilities, and less time to do them all. With less free-time each year, it feels like I want to make the most of the few pockets of time that I have to do things that I really enjoy.

It turns out that despite my history of falling asleep almost daily in my high school english literature class, that writing is still something that I really enjoy. Now that I'm a software engineer, it tends to take the form of literal computer code and documentation.

I started this blog hoping that I could improve my writing skills, but also as a way of keeping an online journal of random topics - whether it be technical writings or random musings about life.

If anyone's reading this - thanks. I hope I can return the favor by writing interesting articles.
